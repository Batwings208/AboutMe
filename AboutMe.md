- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Batwings208

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming mostly in python and I have about 2 years of experience. I love to help those in need and I am also sort of working on Unreal Engine to create a game using C#.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currenting learning C# so I can begin developing applications but I have learned Python and created some very interesting projects which I haven't shared.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me? You may contact me by shooting me an email at "zeeshoo2006@gmail.com". Please contact me for only professional business and I am not offering services, just to collaborate.
